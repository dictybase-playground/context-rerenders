## Context Rerenders

Playing around with different uses of `Context`.

The UI is split into three sections. The top shows an example of global context,
and the bottom two show separated contexts that handle only their section of the application.

To use the [React Profiler](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/09/10/introducing-the-react-profiler.html)
with the production build of this app, use `npx react-scripts build --profile` then serve it with a
static server.
